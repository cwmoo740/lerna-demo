This is an example of developing a UI with exportable packages.

The folders under packages/* can be published to npm for use elsewhere.

They're also used locally in src/client.

Make sure that you have a recent version of yarn installed:

https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable

Then run

`yarn && yarn start`
